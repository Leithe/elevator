Project in Real Time Programming course NTNU

Check for new elevators, or new init?

initFile containing:
    * Num elevators?
    * Port
    * IP of elevators

elevator object ( connectonMap statusArr queueArr floor?)

sharedVariables:
    * New order
    * New staus


Thoughts:
* An elevator dies, and comes back to life. Needs to be updated.
* How to set the order if the elevator will stop in several floors on the
  way.
* Handling of shared variables. Can we secure that the queue will be
  handled properly?
* The queue array should "always" be empty.
